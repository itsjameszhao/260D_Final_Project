# Latent Gaussian Compression for Efficient Cross-Modal Data Representation

We propose Latent Gaussian Compression (LGC), a novel method for efficient cross-modal data representation using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) latent spaces, Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), and Information Bottleneck (IB) principles. LGC achieves efficient compression by organizing the latent space to support locality preservation and smoothness, balancing accuracy and compression through controlled mutual information retention. This approach is well-suited for multi-modal applications, such as infrared-to-RGB mapping, vision-augmented IR superresolution, and privacy-preserving surveillance. LGC achieves high-fidelity representation and efficient retrieval with a significant reduction in data requirements.

## Introduction

Machine learning for cross-modal data representation benefits from efficient encoding schemes that retain essential information while supporting fast retrieval and seamless data transfer between domains. Our Latent Gaussian Compression (LGC) framework applies Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) latent spaces, Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), and Information Bottleneck (IB) regularization to achieve efficient compression, particularly in the context of cross-modal applications such as IR and RGB data fusion.

This paper presents an approach to compress and represent data by balancing accuracy and storage efficiency in the latent space. LGC enables the generation of high-fidelity representations of multi-modal data while significantly reducing data transmission requirements, supporting applications in privacy-preserving surveillance, autonomous navigation, and efficient streaming.

### Overview of Latent Gaussian Compression

LGC leverages VAEs with GMMs to model complex, multi-modal distributions in the latent space. By combining the Information Bottleneck principle with contrastive learning and LSH-based initialization, our approach achieves a structured latent space that preserves locality and minimizes information redundancy.

### Contributions

Our primary contributions include:

- A novel approach for cross-modal latent space organization using VAEs with GMM latent representations, preserving multi-modal features for efficient cross-domain transfer.
- Integration of Information Bottleneck regularization to control the trade-off between compression and accuracy, retaining critical information for high-quality reconstruction.
- Implementation of LSH for locality-preserving retrieval, facilitating efficient and quick cross-modal transformations.
- Application to real-world use cases, including IR-to-RGB superresolution and privacy-preserving surveillance.

## Latent Gaussian Compression Framework

### VAE-GMM Architecture

The VAE-GMM framework models data with a Gaussian Mixture Model in the latent space. Each sample \(x\) is mapped to a distribution in latent space by the encoder as:

$$ z \sim q(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu(x), \sigma(x)^2) $$

where \(z\) represents the latent vector, and \(\mu(x)\) and \(\sigma(x)\) denote the mean and variance.

The GMM prior is defined as:

$$ p(z) = \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k \mathcal{N}(z|\mu_k, \Sigma_k) $$

where \(\pi_k\), \(\mu_k\), and \(\Sigma_k\) denote the weight, mean, and covariance of each Gaussian component \(k\).

### Locality Sensitive Hashing for Latent Space Initialization

We utilize LSH for efficient clustering and retrieval. By hashing similar inputs to nearby codes in the latent space, we ensure that similar data points map to similar clusters, enhancing retrieval efficiency.

### Information Bottleneck Regularization

The Information Bottleneck (IB) objective balances compression and accuracy by optimizing:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{IB}} = I(X; Z) - \beta I(Z; Y)
\]

where \(I(X; Z)\) represents the information retained from input \(X\), and \(I(Z; Y)\) denotes the information relevant for reconstructing \(Y\). The parameter \(\beta\) modulates this trade-off.

## Applications and Results

Our approach achieves notable improvements in compression efficiency and retrieval speed in cross-modal applications. Specifically, we apply LGC to enhance IR-to-RGB transformations, demonstrating how vision-augmented superresolution can improve the quality of IR data.

### Infrared-to-RGB Superresolution

LGC enables high-resolution IR reconstruction by mapping low-resolution IR data to the RGB domain. Through efficient compression and retrieval, we generate RGB-enhanced IR outputs that provide greater detail than IR data alone.

### Privacy-Preserving Surveillance

The latent space compression achieved by LGC allows for privacy-sensitive IR imaging, as it enables thermal data representation without revealing detailed visual content. This is ideal for privacy-preserving applications in sensitive environments.

## Conclusion

Latent Gaussian Compression provides an efficient framework for cross-modal data representation, achieving significant compression while retaining essential features. This approach is adaptable across various domains and applicable to fields that require data-efficient, high-quality cross-modal transformations, such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and remote sensing.
